// MARK: - https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

/**Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.*/

func hasCycle(_ head: ListNode?) -> Bool {
    if head == nil{
        return false
    }
    
    var t = head
    var r = head?.next
    
    while r != nil && r !== t {
        t = t?.next
        r = r?.next?.next
    }
    return r != nil
