/**Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].

Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.

 

Example 1:

Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: We have 3 students where:
The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.
Example 2:

Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: The only student was doing their homework at the queryTime.
Example 3:

Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 5
Output: 0
Example 4:

Input: startTime = [1,1,1,1], endTime = [1,3,2,4], queryTime = 7
Output: 0
Example 5:

Input: startTime = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], endTime = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], queryTime = 5
Output: 5*/

func busyStudent(_ startTime: [Int], _ endTime: [Int], _ queryTime: Int) -> Int {
    var c = 0
    
    for i in 0..<startTime.count{
        
        if startTime[i]<=queryTime && queryTime <= endTime[i]{
            c += 1
        }
        
    }
    return c
    
}
